# Starting guide for React Native

1. Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer
2. Install git on your computer (must be in Windows PATH)
3. Follow these instructions

```bash
cd src/main/front
npm i
npm start
```

4. If you are working with self-signed certificate (unsecured) on the backend side, your browser will probably refuse to contact the backend. In order to fix this issue, just browse a backend URL like https://localhost:8443/q/dev/ and trust the certificate in your browser, it will then allow your frontend to contact the backend
